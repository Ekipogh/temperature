# Daemon 429 Error Fix

## Problem
The daemon would crash on line 162 when encountering 429 (rate limit) errors during device initialization. The issue was:

```python
# Line 162 (BEFORE)
raise RuntimeError("No devices were successfully initialized after retries")
```

When all devices failed to initialize due to API rate limiting, the daemon would raise a RuntimeError and crash completely.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Graceful Device Initialization Failure Handling**
- **BEFORE**: Crash with RuntimeError when no devices initialize
- **AFTER**: Log error and continue running, allowing retry in main loop

```python
# AFTER - Lines 160-165
if not self.devices:
    logger.error("No devices were successfully initialized after retries")
    logger.info("Daemon will continue running and retry device initialization in the main loop")
    # Don't crash - let the daemon continue and try again later
```

### 2. **Main Loop Device Re-initialization**
Added logic to the main daemon loop to re-attempt device initialization when no devices are available:

```python
# Check if we have devices, if not try to initialize them
if not self.devices:
    logger.warning("No devices available, attempting to re-initialize...")
    try:
        self._init_devices()
        if not self.devices:
            logger.warning("Device re-initialization failed, will retry next cycle")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during device re-initialization: {e}")
```

### 3. **Intelligent Failure Counting**
Modified the consecutive failure tracking to be more lenient with device initialization failures:

```python
# Track consecutive failures
if cycle_success:
    consecutive_failures = 0
elif not self.devices:
    # Don't count device initialization failures as harshly
    # since they're usually due to rate limiting and recoverable
    logger.warning("No devices available - will retry initialization next cycle")
else:
    consecutive_failures += 1
    # ... normal failure handling
```

## Benefits

✅ **No More Crashes**: Daemon survives 429 rate limit errors during startup
✅ **Self-Recovery**: Automatically retries device initialization in subsequent cycles
✅ **Resilient Operation**: Continues running even when temporarily rate-limited
✅ **Intelligent Retry**: Uses existing exponential backoff for API calls
✅ **Better Logging**: Clear status messages about device availability

## Test Results

- ✅ Daemon starts successfully even with 429 errors
- ✅ Continues running and retries device initialization
- ✅ Exponential backoff still works for API rate limiting
- ✅ Normal operation resumes once rate limits clear
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass

## Impact

This fix ensures the daemon is production-ready and can handle temporary API rate limiting without manual intervention. The daemon will now:

1. Start successfully even if initial device initialization fails
2. Continuously retry device initialization in the background
3. Resume normal operation once API rate limits are lifted
4. Maintain comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

The fix makes the daemon much more robust for real-world deployment scenarios where API rate limiting is common.
