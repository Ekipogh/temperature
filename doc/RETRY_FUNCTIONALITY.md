# Enhanced Retry Functionality with Exponential Backoff

## ✅ Implementation Summary

Added sophisticated retry logic with exponential backoff for handling SwitchBot API rate limiting (HTTP 429 errors) during device initialization and data collection.

## 🔄 Retry Strategy

### **Exponential Backoff Algorithm**
- **Base Interval**: 60 seconds (1 minute)
- **Growth Pattern**: Doubles each retry (60s → 2m → 4m → 8m → 16m → 32m → 1h → 2h → 4h → 8h → 16h → 24h)
- **Maximum Interval**: 24 hours (86,400 seconds)
- **Jitter**: ±25% random variation to prevent thundering herd

### **Retry Formula**
```python
delay = min(base_interval * (2^retry_count), max_interval)
jittered_delay = delay ± (delay * 0.25)
```

## 🎯 Integration Points

### **1. Device Initialization (`_init_devices`)**
- **Max Attempts**: 5 per device
- **Retry Scope**: Only for HTTP 429 (rate limiting) errors
- **Behavior**:
  - Retries each device independently
  - Uses exponential backoff between attempts
  - Continues with other devices if one fails
  - Resets retry state on any successful device initialization

### **2. Temperature Reading (`get_temperature`)**
- **Max Attempts**: 3 per reading attempt
- **Retry Scope**: HTTP 429 errors only
- **Behavior**:
  - Retries within the same data collection cycle
  - Uses exponential backoff between attempts
  - Resets retry state on successful reading

### **3. Humidity Reading (`get_humidity`)**
- **Max Attempts**: 3 per reading attempt
- **Retry Scope**: HTTP 429 errors only
- **Behavior**: Same as temperature reading

## 📊 Status Tracking

### **New Status Fields**
```json
{
  "rate_limit_retry_count": 0,
  "next_retry_interval": null
}
```

### **Retry State Management**
- **Increment**: `rate_limit_retry_count++` on each 429 error
- **Reset**: Set to 0 on any successful API call
- **Persistence**: Tracked across daemon iterations
- **Logging**: Detailed retry progress with timestamps

## 🔧 Error Handling Strategy

### **Rate Limiting (HTTP 429)**
```
Retry #1: Wait 60s (1 minute)
Retry #2: Wait 120s (2 minutes)
Retry #3: Wait 240s (4 minutes)
Retry #4: Wait 480s (8 minutes)
Retry #5: Wait 960s (16 minutes)
...
Retry #N: Wait up to 86,400s (24 hours)
```

### **Authentication Errors (HTTP 401)**
- **Strategy**: Reinitialize SwitchBot connection
- **No Retry**: Let next daemon iteration handle it
- **Fallback**: Skip current reading attempt

### **Other Errors**
- **Strategy**: Log error and continue
- **No Retry**: Assume non-recoverable
- **Behavior**: Return None, let daemon continue

## 📈 Retry Progression Example

| Retry # | Interval | Cumulative Wait | Status |
|---------|----------|-----------------|---------|
| 0 | - | 0s | Initial attempt |
| 1 | 60s | 1m | First retry |
| 2 | 120s | 3m | Second retry |
| 3 | 240s | 7m | Third retry |
| 4 | 480s | 15m | Fourth retry |
| 5 | 960s | 31m | Fifth retry |
| 6 | 1920s | 63m | Sixth retry |
| 7 | 3840s | 127m | Seventh retry |
| 8 | 7680s | 255m | Eighth retry |
| 9 | 15360s | 511m | Ninth retry |
| 10 | 30720s | 1023m | Tenth retry |
| 11+ | 86400s | +24h | Maximum interval |

## 🚨 Critical Rate Limiting Features

### **Smart Retry Logic**
- **Targeted**: Only retries HTTP 429 errors
- **Progressive**: Exponential backoff prevents API hammering
- **Limited**: Maximum attempts per operation
- **Jittered**: Random variation prevents synchronized retries

### **State Persistence**
- **Cross-Iteration**: Retry count persists between daemon cycles
- **Status Reporting**: Current retry state visible in status
- **Reset Condition**: Successful API call resets retry counter
- **Monitoring**: Web dashboard shows retry status

### **Graceful Degradation**
- **Partial Success**: Continue with successful devices
- **Daemon Resilience**: Daemon doesn't crash on rate limits
- **Data Collection**: Attempts all devices even if some fail
- **Recovery**: Automatic retry state reset on success

## 🔍 Logging Output Examples

### **Successful Retry Sequence**
```
WARNING - Rate limit during device initialization for living_room_thermometer (attempt 1/5)
WARNING - Rate limit error during device initialization for living_room_thermometer. Retry #1, waiting 60 seconds.
INFO - Initialized device: living_room_thermometer (D40E84863006)
INFO - API call successful after 1 rate limit retries
```

### **Maximum Retry Reached**
```
WARNING - Rate limit during temperature reading for bedroom_thermometer (attempt 3/3)
CRITICAL - Reached maximum retry interval of 86400 seconds (24 hours). API rate limiting may be severe.
ERROR - Failed to get temperature from bedroom_thermometer after 3 attempts due to rate limiting
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### **API Compliance**
- ✅ Respects API rate limits with intelligent backoff
- ✅ Prevents daemon from being permanently blocked
- ✅ Reduces server load on SwitchBot API

### **System Resilience**
- ✅ Daemon continues operating during rate limits
- ✅ Automatic recovery when rate limits lift
- ✅ Maintains data collection for unaffected devices

### **Monitoring & Visibility**
- ✅ Real-time retry status in web dashboard
- ✅ Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- ✅ Status file shows current retry state

The enhanced retry system ensures the temperature daemon can gracefully handle API rate limiting while maintaining system functionality and providing clear visibility into retry operations.
