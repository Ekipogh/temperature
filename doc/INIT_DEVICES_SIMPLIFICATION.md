# Summary of _init_devices Simplification

## What Was Updated

### 1. Simplified `_init_devices` Method

**Before (Complex version with retry logic):**
- Had complex retry logic for device initialization
- Tried to handle rate limiting during device setup
- Had error recovery and backoff mechanisms
- Used loops and exception handling for each device
- ~80 lines of complex code

**After (Simplified version):**
- Simply stores MAC addresses from environment variables
- No retry logic or error handling (delegated to service layer)
- Clean and straightforward configuration
- ~15 lines of simple code

```python
def _init_devices(self):
    """Initialize device configuration by storing MAC addresses."""
    # Device configuration - can be moved to environment variables if needed
    device_configs = {
        "living_room_thermometer": os.getenv("LIVING_ROOM_MAC", "D40E84863006"),
        "bedroom_thermometer": os.getenv("BEDROOM_MAC", "D40E84861814"),
        "office_thermometer": os.getenv("OFFICE_MAC", "D628EA1C498F"),
        "outdoor_thermometer": os.getenv("OUTDOOR_MAC", "D40E84064570"),
    }

    # Simply store the MAC addresses - the SwitchBotService handles all device communication
    self.devices = device_configs.copy()

    logger.info(f"Configured {len(self.devices)} devices: {list(self.devices.keys())}")
```

### 2. Updated Test Structure

**Updated `test_daemon.py` with:**
- New test for default MAC addresses
- New test for custom MAC addresses from environment
- New test for device configuration structure
- Improved mock setup to avoid type conflicts
- Removed obsolete tests for retry logic (since _init_devices no longer has it)

**Key Test Methods Added:**
- `test_daemon_initialization_with_default_macs()` - Tests default MAC addresses
- `test_daemon_initialization_with_custom_macs()` - Tests environment variable MAC addresses
- `test_device_configuration_structure()` - Tests device configuration consistency

### 3. Validation Results

✅ **Confirmed Working:**
- Simplified `_init_devices` correctly stores MAC addresses
- Environment variable configuration works (both custom and defaults)
- Device configuration structure is consistent
- Service pattern properly separates concerns

## Benefits of the Simplification

1. **Cleaner Separation of Concerns**
   - Device initialization = just store configuration
   - Service layer = handle all communication and error handling
   - No duplication of retry logic between init and service methods

2. **Easier Testing**
   - No complex retry logic to test in _init_devices
   - Straightforward configuration testing
   - Service behavior tested separately

3. **Better Maintainability**
   - Simple, readable code
   - Clear responsibilities
   - Less complex state management

4. **Improved Architecture**
   - Service pattern properly implemented
   - Configuration separated from communication
   - Error handling centralized in service layer

## Impact on Existing Functionality

- ✅ All existing device methods (`get_temperature`, `get_humidity`) continue to work
- ✅ Environment variable configuration preserved
- ✅ Service layer handles all error recovery and rate limiting
- ✅ Default MAC addresses preserved
- ✅ Logging and monitoring remain functional

The simplification removes unnecessary complexity while maintaining all required functionality through the service layer architecture.
