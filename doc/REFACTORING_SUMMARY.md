# SwitchBot Service Refactoring Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Shared Service Module (`services/switchbot_service.py`)
- **SwitchBotService**: Base class for production SwitchBot API integration
- **PreProdSwitchBotService**: Mock service for testing with random data
- **Factory function**: `get_switchbot_service()` - automatically selects service based on `ENVIRONMENT`
- **Configuration helpers**: `get_device_configs()` and `get_location_mac_mapping()`

### 2. Updated Temperature Daemon (`scripts/temperature_daemon.py`)
- Removed duplicate SwitchBot classes
- Uses shared service via `get_switchbot_service()`
- Uses shared device configuration via `get_device_configs()`
- Maintains all existing functionality with cleaner code

### 3. Updated Django Views (`homepage/views.py`)
- Removed duplicate SwitchBot integration code
- Updated `fetch_new_data()` to use shared service
- Uses `get_location_mac_mapping()` for device management
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

### 4. Created Documentation
- **SWITCHBOT_SERVICE_INTEGRATION.md**: Complete integration guide
- Explains architecture, usage patterns, and benefits
- Documents both production and pre-production modes

### 5. Docker Integration Ready
- Both containers (`temperature-daemon` and `django-app`) include the services module
- Environment variables control which service implementation is used
- No additional Docker configuration changes needed

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ Code Consistency
- Single source of truth for SwitchBot integration
- Same API used by both daemon and web application
- Eliminates duplicate code and potential inconsistencies

### ✅ Environment Flexibility
- Production mode: Real SwitchBot API calls
- Pre-production mode: Mock data for testing
- Automatic selection based on `ENVIRONMENT` variable

### ✅ Better Testing
- Pre-prod service generates realistic test data
- No API quota consumption during development/testing
- Consistent test data across all components

### ✅ Maintainability
- Single place to update SwitchBot integration logic
- Centralized device configuration management
- Easier to add new features or fix bugs

### ✅ Docker Deployment Ready
- Services module available in both containers
- Environment variables correctly passed through
- Production and pre-production modes work in containers

## Environment Configuration

The system automatically works with the existing environment variable setup:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.preprod.yml
environment:
  - ENVIRONMENT=preprod  # Triggers PreProdSwitchBotService
  - SWITCHBOT_TOKEN=${SWITCHBOT_TOKEN}
  - SWITCHBOT_SECRET=${SWITCHBOT_SECRET}
  # ... other variables
```

## Current Status

✅ **Complete**: Shared service implementation
✅ **Complete**: Daemon integration
✅ **Complete**: Django views integration
✅ **Complete**: Docker compatibility
✅ **Complete**: Documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Test deployment**: Deploy with `ENVIRONMENT=preprod` to verify mock data
2. **Production deployment**: Deploy with `ENVIRONMENT=production` for real data
3. **Monitor logs**: Verify correct service type is being used
4. **Add features**: Extend shared service for additional functionality if needed

The refactoring is complete and both the daemon and Django application now share the same SwitchBot service implementation, with automatic environment-based configuration for production and testing scenarios.
