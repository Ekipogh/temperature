# Code Formatting Configuration

## Problem Solved ✅

**Issue**: isort and black had conflicting formatting rules for `scripts/temperature_daemon.py`
- isort wanted imports organized in one way
- black wanted different spacing between import groups
- CI/CD pipeline would fail due to these conflicts

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created `pyproject.toml` Configuration
Added a comprehensive configuration file that makes isort and black work together:

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ['py39']

[tool.isort]
profile = "black"  # This is the key - makes isort compatible with black
multi_line_output = 3
line_length = 88
```

### 2. Key Configuration Details

**Black Settings**:
- Line length: 88 characters (Python standard)
- Target Python 3.9+ compatibility
- Excludes migrations and other auto-generated files

**isort Settings**:
- `profile = "black"` - Ensures compatibility with black formatting
- Custom sections for Django imports
- Same line length as black (88)
- Skips migration files

**Coverage & MyPy**:
- Configured for comprehensive code quality checks
- Excludes test files and migrations from coverage requirements

### 3. Benefits

✅ **No more conflicts**: isort and black now work together seamlessly
✅ **Consistent formatting**: All team members get the same code style
✅ **CI/CD compatibility**: Automated checks will pass consistently
✅ **Industry standard**: Using pyproject.toml is the modern Python approach

### 4. Usage

```bash
# Format imports and code (both commands work together now)
isort .
black .

# Check formatting (for CI/CD)
isort --check-only .
black --check .
```

### 5. Files Affected
- ✅ `scripts/temperature_daemon.py` - Fixed and formatted
- ✅ `homepage/views.py` - Fixed import sorting
- ✅ All other Python files - Now consistently formatted
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline - Will run without formatting conflicts

## Result
The Django temperature monitoring project now has consistent, conflict-free code formatting that works seamlessly in both local development and CI/CD environments.
